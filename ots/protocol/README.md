# Protocols

The onet-framework uses protocol at its lowest level to define communication
patterns betwen nodes. In this directory two protocols are defined that
are both used by the service:

- dkg - Distributed Key Generation, an implementation of the following paper:
"Secure Distributed Key Generation for Discrete-Log
Based Cryptosystems" by R. Gennaro, S. Jarecki, H. Krawczyk, and T. Rabin.
- ocs - onchain-secret, an implementation of the work-in-progress by
Kokoris Kogias Eleftherios <eleftherios.kokoriskogias@epfl.ch>

## Distributed Key Generation

The DKG protocol creates random shares of a secret key that are only
stored at each node. Together these nodes create a public shared key
without creating the secret shared key. As a group they can encrypt
and decrypt data without the need to create the secret shared key,
but with each node participating in part of the encryption or
decryption.

## Onchain-Secrets

Based on the DKG, data that is ElGamal encrypted using the public
shared key from the DKG can be re-encrypted under another public key
without the data being in the clear at any given moment. This is used
in the onchain-secrets skipchain when a reader wants to recover the
symmetric key.
